# AkiBot - Multi-purpose Discord bot
## Purpose
AkiBot was created by me in Spring 2017 as a way to test my knowledge of using Java in a larger, more structured application 
than what I have made in classes before. I spent most of my free time from March-July of 2017 working on this bot on-and-off adding 
more features and commands as I went. I have placed a high priority on maintaining very clean and efficient code wherever possible, 
which always brought me back to try to improve the code even more over time.

You can invite AkiBot to a Discord server using this link: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=313955083584929792&permissions=8&scope=bot

**NOTE**: I do not regularly turn the bot online, as this was primarily for my own learning and not for actual public release. 
Please contact me on Discord at Phoenix#0353 if you would like me to turn the bot on for you to try it out.
